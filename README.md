# Project-Euler-R
One year of Project Euler Challenges in the R Language

My contributions to the [Lets go to Quora](https://www.quora.com), a series of programming problems designed to test and broaden algorithmic and mathematical thinking. All problems are completed in R, with the goal of working through 2 problems per day for each day of 2022. As part of my individual challenge, each solution must be written in under an hour, thus some problems are not optimized from a SWE perspective. The intent is to improve my ability to quickly parse mathematical problems and implement very workable - if not optimal - programmatic solutions.
