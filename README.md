# Project-Euler-R
One year of Project Euler Challenges in the R Language

My contributions to the [Project Euler Challenge] (https://projecteuler.net/), a series of programming problems designed to test and broaden algorithmic and mathematical thinking. All problems are completed in R, working through 2 problems per day for each day of 2022. Individual solutions must be written in under an hour, thus some problems are not optimized from a SWE perspective. The intent is to improve quickly parsing mathematical problems and implementing workable - if not optimal - programmatic solutions.
